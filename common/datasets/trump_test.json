Hardaway and her co-host Richardson are former Democrats. The duo came to wider prominence in 2015 as supporters of conservative Presidential candidate Donald Trump after posting a video criticizing Fox News host Megyn Kelly for asking irrelevant questions during the first GOP candidate debate. While they are not formally affiliated with the Trump campaign or paid by it, they have been urging other supporters of Trump to follow suit on social media and at rallies. They have also created a \"ditch and switch\" website explaining to voters which states are closed primaries and when the deadlines are for changing party affiliations. They are biological sisters from North Carolina who say they stand with the silent majority, voicing their opinions about \"media bias, political babble, and repetitive political tactics that they feel the average American is tired of being subjected to.\" \nThe duo first joined Donald Trump as the Stump for Trump Girls on stage at his Raleigh, North Carolina rally on December 4, 2015. They later riled up the crowd at the Trump rally on January 2, 2016, in Biloxi, Mississippi, that attracted more than 14,000 people. At the Biloxi rally, the duo urged Democrats and independents in the audience to \"ditch and switch\", \"i.e.\", to register as Republicans and vote for Donald Trump in the primary and general election. It is believed that these two sisters are having a big impact because Americans from different nationality are changing their party affiliation from Democrats and Independents to Republicans just to vote for Donald J. Trump.\n\n"}
